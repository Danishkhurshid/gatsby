# using-graphql-typegen

Example project for the documentation page [GraphQL Typegen](https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/graphql-typegen).

Run `npm install` and `npm run develop` to get started. If you have VSCode installed with the [GraphQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) you can get autocompletion inside VSCode itself for an query. You can access the global namespace `Queries` to type your query responses.
