## Introduction

If you're already using [Gatsby with TypeScript](/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/typescript) and manually typing the results of your queries, you'll learn in this guide how Gatsby's automatic GraphQL Typegen feature can make your life easier by relying on the types that are generated by Gatsby itself. You'll also learn how to get autocompletion for GraphQL queries in your IDE.

At the moment this feature is behind a feature flag and in active development. You can voice your feedback in [RFC: GraphQL Typegen](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35420).

## Prerequisites

- `gatsby@4.14.0` or later installed.
- The flag `GRAPHQL_TYPEGEN` set inside `gatsby-config`.
  ```js:title=gatsby-config.js
  module.exports = {
    flags: {
      GRAPHQL_TYPEGEN: true,
    }
  }
  ```
- Pages (`src/pages`) that use TypeScript and/or `gatsby-node.ts`.
